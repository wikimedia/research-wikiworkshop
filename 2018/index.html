                                    Long-range planning is an integral part of the creation of on-line content, where for example people work toward reputational milestones, build up to administrative roles, or complete complex projects.  To understand these kinds of processes, we need to enrich our models with the types of human behavioral biases that come into play when people attempt to reach long-range goals --- particularly, the tendency toward present bias, in which costs and benefits incurred in the present receive particular weight. We develop a network model for the process of planning with present bias, and show how this model directly produces a wide range of qualitative phenomena observed in the literature on present-biased behavior, including procrastination, abandonment of long-range tasks, and the benefits of reduced sets of choices. We then show how this model can naturally incorporate other behavioral phenomena, including sophistication in planning, and the interaction of present bias with sunk-cost bias. (This talk is based on joint work with Sigal Oren and Manish Raghavan.)

                                    Large knowledge graphs have become a powerful asset for search, analytics, recommendations and data integration, with intensive use at big industrial stakeholders. They have focused on encyclopedic facts about entities such as people, places and products. However, they lack various other dimensions of knowledge. For advanced search, conversational bots, visual understanding and next-generation AI, computers need to be equipped with broader kinds of knowledge: quantitative modifiers of facts, plausibility invariants, properties of everyday objects, human activities and spatio-temporal as well as socio-cultural context. This talk discusses these new frontiers for machine knowledge.

                                    When someone uses bad information, it’s often because the tools they used to find that information were not designed to help them make good judgements. The need for an integrated design response to the problem of information assessment is critical in an age of participatory information sources like wikis. Technologies can be designed to support human needs in different ways; for example, they can be designed using principles of usability, accessibility, or ergonomics. However, design sciences currently lack a shared vocabulary for talking about “assessability” — those properties of designed spaces that allow people to assess information they find. Assessable designs don’t just deliver assessments of information quality, they support people in getting <i>better</i> at judging the information they encounter online. In this talk I’ll discuss experiments with assessable designs as well as introduce a nascent research agenda on privacy and anonymity in open collaboration projects.

                                    Fighting online disinformation and misinformation is a challenging task that requires collaboration between the journalists, the researchers, the platforms, and the standards communities. The ClaimReview structured data (http://schema.org/ClaimReview) is a successful example of such collaborations and it powers the various fact check features in Google and Bing. In the first part of the talk, I will describe the genesis of ClaimReview and the various fact check features Google has provided to users based on ClaimReview. I will then dive a bit deeper into our recent technical work on leveraging AI techniques to identify relevant documents for claims made within the fact-checking articles. I will describe the significant challenges that still remain in solving this association problem. In the second part of the talk, I will highlight several similarly collaborative projects including the Trust Project and the W3C Credible Web Community Group that aim to provide a variety of open standard credibility signals for news articles. I will conclude by looking at how the Wiki community can contribute collectively to address this important challenge of our society.

                                    Wikidata, the knowledge base of Wikimedia, has been extremely successful in building and sustaining new communities of editors and users. Since its inception in 2012, it has developed from an experimental “data wiki” into a well-organised reference knowledge base with an amazing array of applications. You can now come across Wikidata content in your mobile phone, in newspaper articles, and even in aeroplanes. A key towards this success has been the development of a whole ecosystem of tools and APIs for accessing, querying, and analysing Wikidata content. The most prominent such feature is Wikidata's powerful query service, which is based on the Semantic Web data exchange standard RDF and its related query language SPARQL. The talk will give an overview over these developments and focus specifically on the possibilities and current usage of SPARQL on Wikidata.

                            Wikipedia is one of the most popular sites on the Web, a main source of knowledge for
                            a large fraction of Internet users, and one of the very few projects that make not only their
                            content but also many activity logs available to the public. Furthermore, other Wikimedia projects,
                            such as Wikidata and Wikimedia Commons, have been created to share other types of
                            knowledge with the world for free. For a variety of reasons (quality and quantity of content,
                            reach in many languages, process of content production, availability of data, etc.) such projects
                            have become important objects of study for researchers across many subfields of the computational
                            and social sciences, such as social network analysis, artificial intelligence, linguistics,
                            natural language processing, social psychology, education, anthropology, political science,
                            human&ndash;computer interaction, and cognitive science.

                            The goal of this workshop
                            is to bring together researchers exploring all aspects of Wikimedia projects such as Wikipedia,
                            Wikidata, and Commons. With members of the Wikimedia Foundation's Research team on the
                            organizing committee and with the experience of successful
                            workshops in <a href="https://wikiworkshop.org/2015/">2015</a>, <a href="https://wikiworkshop.org/2016/">2016</a>, and <a href="https://wikiworkshop.org/2017/">2017</a>, we aim to continue facilitating a direct pathway for exchanging ideas between the organization that
                            coordinates Wikimedia projects and the researchers interested in studying them.
