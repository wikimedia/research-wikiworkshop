                                <p>Wikidata has quickly become a major wiki project. By becoming so, it has stretched what wikis can be successfully used for. We will take a look at the state of Wikidata, how it can help the Wikipedias (and other projects), and we'll discuss the question if we can take the wiki approach further to even more complex approaches, such as an Abstract Wikipedia.</p>

                                <h5>Understanding the Limitations of AI: When Algorithms Fail</h5>
                                <p>Automated decision making tools are currently used in high stakes scenarios. From natural language processing tools used to automatically determine one’s suitability for a job, to health diagnostic systems trained to determine a patient’s outcome, machine learning models are used to make decisions that can have serious consequences on people’s lives. In spite of the consequential nature of these use cases, vendors of such models are not required to perform specific tests showing the suitability of their models for a given task. Nor are they required to provide documentation describing the characteristics of their models, or disclose the results of algorithmic audits to ensure that certain groups are not unfairly treated. I will show some examples to examine the dire consequences of basing decisions entirely on machine learning based systems, and discuss recent work on auditing and exposing the gender and skin tone bias found in commercial gender classification systems. I will end with the concept of an AI datasheet to standardize information for datasets and pre-trained models, in order to push the field as a whole towards transparency and accountability.</p>

                                <p>
                                    “I sometimes think that general and popular treatises are almost as important for the progress of science as original work.” — Charles Darwin<br/>
                                    As the largest encyclopedia in the world, it is not surprising that Wikipedia reflects the state of scientific knowledge.  However, Wikipedia is also one of the most accessed websites in the world, including by scientists, which suggests that it also has the potential to shape science. This paper shows that it does.
                                    Incorporating ideas into Wikipedia leads to those ideas being used more in the scientific literature. We provide correlational evidence of this across thousands of Wikipedia articles and causal evidence of it through a randomized control trial where we add new scientific content to Wikipedia. In the months after uploading it, an average new Wikipedia article on Chemistry is read tens of thousands of times and causes changes to hundreds of related scientific journal articles.  Adding references to Wikipedia also has an effect, causing important scientific articles to get more citations.  Our findings speak not only to the influence of Wikipedia, but more broadly to the influence of repositories of knowledge and the role that they play in Science.

                            Wikipedia is one of the most popular sites on the Web, a main source of knowledge for
                            a large fraction of Internet users, and one of the very few projects that make not only their
                            content but also many activity logs available to the public. Furthermore, other Wikimedia projects,
                            such as Wikidata and Wikimedia Commons, have been created to share other types of
                            knowledge with the world for free. For a variety of reasons (quality and quantity of content,
                            reach in many languages, process of content production, availability of data, etc.) such projects
                            have become important objects of study for researchers across many subfields of the computational
                            and social sciences, such as social network analysis, artificial intelligence, linguistics,
                            natural language processing, social psychology, education, anthropology, political science,
                            human&ndash;computer interaction, and cognitive science.

                            The goal of this workshop
                            is to bring together researchers exploring all aspects of Wikimedia projects such as Wikipedia,
                            Wikidata, and Commons. With members of the Wikimedia Foundation's Research team on the
                            organizing committee and with the experience of successful
                            workshops in

                            we aim to continue facilitating a direct pathway for exchanging ideas between the organization that
                            coordinates Wikimedia projects and the researchers interested in studying them.
