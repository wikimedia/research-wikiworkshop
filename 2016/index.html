                Wikipedia's articles are generally of high quality, yet, only a small fraction rank among "featured articles", i.e., articles that are considered to be of the best that Wikipedia has to offer. To coordinate the improvement of less-than-perfect articles, editors may insert template messages into those where flaws have been found to let others know how they can help to improve the articles in question. Mining these template messages gives insights into how Wikipedia articles improve over time. The template messages may also serve as ground truth for prediction technology to identify quality flaws in articles that have not been manually reviewed so far. In the first part of this talk, our corresponding research will be reviewed. The second part, concerns Wikipedia text reuse: it is well-known that Wikipedia's articles are reused and plagiarized all across the web, however, chunks of Wikipedia articles are also reused within Wikipedia. As a first step to retrieve reused text within and without Wikipedia, the Picapica search engine (<a href="http://www.picapica.org">www.picapica.org</a>) is demonstrated where documents can be uploaded to identify text passages that have been reused from Wikipedia. Finally, we will show first results of a pairwise comparison of all Wikipedia articles against each other as well as a graph-based visualization built on top of the article similarity matrix.

                <div class="talk-title">Gender Inequalities in Wikipedia</div>
                Contributing to the writing of history has never been as easy as it is today thanks to Wikipedia, a community-created encyclopedia that aims to document the world’s knowledge from a neutral point of view. Though everyone can participate it is well known that the editor community has a narrow diversity, with a majority of white male editors. While this participatory gender gap has been studied extensively in the literature, this talk sets out to assess potential gender inequalities in Wikipedia articles along different dimensions: notability, topical focus, linguistic bias, structural properties, and meta-data presentation.<br/>
                We find that (i) women in Wikipedia are more notable than men, which we interpret as the outcome of a subtle glass ceiling effect; (ii) family-, gender-, and relationship-related topics are more present in biographies about women; (iii) linguistic bias manifests in Wikipedia since abstract terms tend to be used to describe positive aspects in the biographies of men and negative aspects in the biographies of women; and (iv) there are structural differences in terms of meta-data and hyperlinks, which have consequences for information-seeking activities. While some differences are expected, due to historical and social contexts, other differences are attributable to Wikipedia editors. The implications of such differences are discussed having Wikipedia contribution policies in mind. We hope that the present work will contribute to increased awareness about, first, gender issues in the content of Wikipedia, and second, the different levels on which gender biases can manifest on the Web.

                Online production communities present an exciting opportunity for investigating novel organizational forms. Extant theoretical accounts of knowledge co-production point to organizational policies, norms, and communication as key mechanisms enabling the coordination of work. Yet, in practice participants in initiatives such as Wikipedia are often occasional contributors who are unaware of community policies and do not communicate with other members. How then is work coordinated and how does the organization maintain stability in the face of dynamics in individuals’ task enactment? In this study we develop a conceptualization of emergent roles - the prototypical activity patterns that organically emerge from individuals’ spontaneous actions – and investigate the temporal dynamics of emergent role behaviors. Conducing a multi-level large-scale empirical study stretching over a decade, we tracked co-production of a thousand Wikipedia articles, logging two hundred thousand distinct participants and seven hundred thousand co-production activities, and recording each activity’s type. We identified seven prototypical emergent roles, and found that participants’ behavior is turbulent, with substantial flow in and out of co-production work and across roles. Our findings at the organizational level, however, show that work is organized around a highly stable set of emergent roles, despite the absence of traditional stabilizing mechanisms such as pre-defined work procedures or role expectations. We conceptualize this dualism in emergent work as “Turbulent Stability”. Further analyses suggest that co-production is artifact-centric, where contributors mutually adjust according to the artifact’s changing needs. Our study advances the theoretical understandings of self-organizing knowledge co-production and particularly the nature of emergent roles. We also highlight the implications for custodians of online communities, as well as for managers of firms engaging in self-organized knowledge collaboration.

                Most of the widely used network analytical methods (e.g. centrality indices) were developed 30+ years ago based on observations of and theories related to small groups (&lt;25 people). If we now use these methods for analyzing large-scale hyperlinked data, we face a number of challenges. Scaling of algorithms is the most obvious one, as the algorithmic complexity of many algorithms makes it almost impossible to apply them to networks with millions of nodes. Furthermore, theoretical and methodological questions arise. Do algorithmic assumption and interpretation fit form and size of data? Do underlying small group theories scale to big data. Which traditional research questions still make sense?

                In this talk, I will give an overview of our recent work in the area of knowledge bases. I will first talk about our main project, the YAGO knowledge base. YAGO is now multilingual, and has grown into a larger project at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics and Télécom ParisTech. I will then talk about the alignment of knowledge bases. This includes the alignment of classes, instances, and relations across knowledge bases. The third area is rule mining. We can find semantic correlations in the form of Horn rules in the knowledge base. I will also talk about watermarking approaches to trace the provenance of ontological data. Finally, I will show applications of the knowledge base for mining news corpora.

                People contribute to Wikis and other collaboratively created content in many ways. Some are dedicated writers and editors. Others occasionally fix a typo. And the vast majority of visitors to Wikipedia pages and archives of Question Answering sites (Yahoo Answers, Stackoverflow) never edit a page or answer a question at all. Yet, even these users can and do contribute valuable information. By viewing and interacting with the pages, people implicitly and explicitly indicate quality, interestingness, and relevance of content to their information needs. I will first describe how these signals can be used to improve search ranking, estimating content quality, and even to infer "interesting" regions of the page. These results suggest additional ways to make it easier for casual users to contribute to valuable content, while providing to each users' information needs.

                <div class="talk-title">Incentives in Online Social Systems</div>
                Online social systems are increasingly employing social mechanisms to structure and enhance the user interactions and behaviours they support. In this talk, I'll discuss several such mechanisms and how they could impact wiki communities. Some prominent examples are badge systems, which reward users for accomplishing certain pre-specified achievements. Badges have been employed in many domains, including news sites like the Huffington Post, educational sites like Khan Academy, and knowledge-creation sites like Stack Overflow. At their most basic level, badges serve as a summary of a user’s key accomplishments; however, experience with these sites also shows that users will put in non-trivial amounts of work to achieve particular badges, and as such, badges can act powerfully as incentives. Thus far, however, the incentive structures created by badges have not been well understood, making it difficult to deploy badges with an eye toward the incentives they are likely to create. I will discuss how badges can influence and steer user behavior on a site—leading both to increased participation and to changes in the mix of activities a user pursues on the site. We introduce a formal model for reasoning about user behavior in the presence of badges, and evaluate its predictions by comparing with the empirical use of badges and their effects on the widely used Stack Overflow question-answering site.

                Ashton is a postdoctoral researcher at Microsoft Research NYC. His research is driven by a desire to better understand the increasingly digital social systems that shape our society. He studies a wide array of computational social science problems ranging from mapping the structure of how information and products spread through social networks to investigating how to use badges to incentivize people online. Prior to joining Microsoft Research, he received his Master's and Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford University, where he was supported by a Google Ph.D. Fellowship in Social Computing.

                With the increasing relevance of Wikipedia as a source of information for a wide variety of subjects, our community is increasingly tempted to use Wikipedia as a source for studying social phenomena or social issues of societies at large. A wide variety of sociological concerns are seemingly amenable to research using Wikipedia. In this talk, I intend to (i) discuss the opportunities as well as pitfalls when using Wikipedia for studying social science questions and (ii) give examples of specific studies that tap into Wikipedia data to understand sociological issues such as gender inequality or cultural relations. I will conclude with a number of observations about the future direction of Wikipedia research.

          Wikipedia is one of the most popular sites on the Web, a main source of knowledge for
          a large fraction of Internet users, and one of the very few projects that make not only their
          content but also many activity logs available to the public. Furthermore, other Wikimedia projects,
          such as Wikidata and Wikimedia Commons, have been created to share other types of
          knowledge with the world for free. For a variety of reasons (quality and quantity of content,
          reach in many languages, process of content production, availability of data, etc.) such projects
          have become important objects of study for researchers across many subfields of the computational
          and social sciences, such as social network analysis, artificial intelligence, linguistics,
          natural language processing, social psychology, education, anthropology, political science,
          human&ndash;computer interaction, and cognitive science.
          </p>
          <p>
          The goal of this workshop
          is to bring together researchers exploring all aspects of Wikimedia websites such as Wikipedia,
          Wikidata, and Commons. With members of the Wikimedia Foundation's Research team on the
          organizing committee and with the experience of a successful
          <a href="https://snap.stanford.edu/wiki-icwsm15/">workshop in 2015,</a> we aim to
          continue facilitating a direct pathway for exchanging ideas between the organization that
          operates Wikimedia websites and the researchers interested in studying them.
          </p>
          <p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to</p>
          <ul>
            <li>new technology and initiatives to grow content, quality, diversity, and participation</li>
            <li>collaborative content creation</li>
            <li>consensus-finding and conflict resolution on editorial issues</li>
            <li>content consumption on Wikipedia</li>
            <li>participation in discussions and their dynamics</li>
            <li>collaborative task management</li>
            <li>evolution of hierarchies</li>
            <li>Wikipedia as a sensor for real-world events, culture, etc.</li>
            <li>demographics of Wikipedia readers and editors</li>
            <li>engagement and incentivization of editors</li>
            <li>uses of Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects for AI and NLP applications</li>
          </ul>  
          <p>Papers should be 1 to 8 pages long and will be published on the workshop webpage and optionally
            (depending on the authors' choice) in the workshop proceedings.
            Authors whose papers are accepted to the workshop will have the opportunity to participate in a poster session.
            <!--They are welcome to present their poster at both instances of the workshop (at WWW and ICWSM)
            if it was accepted to one of them.--></p>

          <p>We explicitly encourage the submission of preliminary work in the form of extended abstracts (1 or 2 pages).</p>
