                The Web is the most powerful communication medium and the largest public data repository that humankind has created. Its content ranges from great reference sources such as Wikipedia to ugly fake news. Indeed, social (digital) media is just an amplifying mirror of ourselves. Hence, the main challenge of search engines and other websites that rely on web data is to assess the quality of such data. However, as all people has their own biases, web content as well as our web interactions are tainted with many biases. Data bias includes redundancy and spam, while interaction bias includes activity and presentation bias. In addition, sometimes algorithms add bias, particularly in the context of search and recommendation systems. As bias generates bias, we stress the importance of debiasing data as well as using the context and other techniques such as explore &amp; exploit, to break the filter bubble. The main goal of this talk is to make people aware of the different biases that affect all of us on the Web. Awareness is the first step to be able to fight and reduce the vicious cycle of bias on the Web.

                <div class="talk-title">Conversational Markers of Social Dynamics</div>
                Can conversational dynamics&mdash;the nature of the back and forth between people&mdash;predict the outcomes of social interactions?  In this talk I will introduce a computational framework for modeling conversational dynamics and for extracting the social signals they encode, and apply it in a variety of different settings.  First, I will show how these signals can be predictive of the future evolution of a dyadic relationship. In particular, I will characterize friendships that are unlikely to last and examine temporal patterns that foretell betrayal in the context of the Diplomacy strategy game.  Second, I will discuss conversational patterns that emerge in problem-solving group discussions, and show how these patterns can be indicative of how (in)effective the collaboration is.  I will conclude by focusing on the effects of under and over-confidence on the dynamics and outcomes of decision-making discussions.

                Instances ("Google") and their more specific ("technology company")
and more general ("company", "business") classes are building blocks
of large-scale taxonomies, which in turn are the backbone of knowledge
repositories whether created manually or extracted from text. Data
available within Wikipedia makes it an intriguing resource towards
distinguishing, understanding and populating open-domain, fine-grained
classes relevant to knowledge acquisition and Web search.

                Wikipedia is an unprecedented encyclopaedic resource and a model for large-scale knowledge management. It provides core data for modern knowledge systems like search contextualisation and text linking. And it points the way for other endeavours that seek to solicit and coordinate the collective knowledge of many users. In this talk, I will review learnings from nearly ten years of applying Wiki principles in research and commercial projects, e.g., strategies for applications that require entities or knowledge beyond Wikipedia. And I will discuss new models that are helping us move beyond collective knowledge towards interactive intelligence.

          Wikipedia is one of the most popular sites on the Web, a main source of knowledge for
          a large fraction of Internet users, and one of the very few projects that make not only their
          content but also many activity logs available to the public. Furthermore, other Wikimedia projects,
          such as Wikidata and Wikimedia Commons, have been created to share other types of
          knowledge with the world for free. For a variety of reasons (quality and quantity of content,
          reach in many languages, process of content production, availability of data, etc.) such projects
          have become important objects of study for researchers across many subfields of the computational
          and social sciences, such as social network analysis, artificial intelligence, linguistics,
          natural language processing, social psychology, education, anthropology, political science,
          human&ndash;computer interaction, and cognitive science.
          </p>
          <p>
          The goal of this workshop
          is to bring together researchers exploring all aspects of Wikimedia websites such as Wikipedia,
          Wikidata, and Commons. With members of the Wikimedia Foundation's Research team on the
          organizing committee and with the experience of successful
          workshops in <a href="https://wikiworkshop.org/2015/">2015</a> and <a href="https://wikiworkshop.org/2016/">2016</a>, we aim to
          continue facilitating a direct pathway for exchanging ideas between the organization that
          operates Wikimedia websites and the researchers interested in studying them.
          </p>
          <p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to</p>
          <ul>
            <li>new technologies and initiatives to grow content, quality, diversity, and participation across Wikimedia projects</li>
            <li> use of bots, algorithms, and crowdsourcing strategies to curate, source, or verify content and structured data</li>
            <li> bias in content and gaps of knowledge</li>
            <li> diversity of Wikimedia editors and users</li>
            <li> understanding editor motivations, engagement models, and incentives</li>
            <li> Wikimedia consumer motivations and their needs: readers, researchers, tool/API developers</li>
            <li> innovative uses of Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects for AI and NLP applications</li>
            <li> consensus-finding and conflict resolution on editorial issues</li>
            <li> participation in discussions and their dynamics</li>
            <li> dynamics of content reuse across projects and the impact of policies and community norms on reuse</li>
            <li> privacy</li>
            <li> collaborative content creation (unstructured, semi-structured, or structured)</li>
            <li> collaborative task management</li>
            <li> innovative uses of Wikimedia projects' content and consumption patterns as sensors for real-world events, culture, etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Papers should be 1 to 8 pages long and will be published on the workshop webpage and optionally
            (depending on the authors' choice) in the workshop proceedings.
            Authors whose papers are accepted to the workshop will have the opportunity to participate in a poster session.
            <!--They are welcome to present their poster at both instances of the workshop (at WWW and ICWSM)
            if it was accepted to one of them.--></p>
