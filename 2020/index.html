                <div class="talk-title">Wisdom of Polarized Crowds</div>
                As political polarization in the United States continues to rise, the question of whether polarized individuals can fruitfully cooperate becomes pressing. Although diverse perspectives typically lead to superior team performance on complex tasks, strong political perspectives have been associated with conflict, misinformation and a reluctance to engage with people and ideas beyond one’s echo chamber. Here, we explore the effect of ideological composition on team performance by analysing millions of edits to Wikipedia’s political, social issues and science articles. We measure editors’ online ideological preferences by how much they contribute to conservative versus liberal articles. Editor surveys suggest that online contributions associate with offline political party affiliation and ideological self-identity. Our analysis reveals that polarized teams consisting of a balanced set of ideologically diverse editors produce articles of a higher quality than homogeneous teams. The effect is most clearly seen in Wikipedia’s political articles, but also in social issues and even science articles. Analysis of article ‘talk pages’ reveals that ideologically polarized teams engage in longer, more constructive, competitive and substantively focused but linguistically diverse debates than teams of ideological moderates. More intense use of Wikipedia policies by ideologically diverse teams suggests institutional design principles to help unleash the power of polarization.

                Misha Teplitskiy is an Assistant Professor at the School of Information, University of Michigan. His research is at the intersection of Science of Science + Sociology of Organizations + Computational Social Science. He studies how social and organizational factors affect scientific discovery. He is especially interested in evaluation practices in science, and whether they promote or stifle innovation. My approach relies primarily on field experiments -- interventions in scientific competitions and other settings -- and applying computational tools to large-scale observational data. Previously, he was a postdoc at the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (LISH). He received his PhD in Sociology from the University of Chicago, where he was a member of KnowledgeLab.

                The Internet Archive is a San Francisco based non-profit dedicated to the mission of Universal Access to All Knowledge.  It is best known for the Wayback Machine, which has been archiving much of the public Web for the past 24 years.  To date more than 900 billion URLs have been archived and nearly a billion are added every day.  But the Internet Archive is engaged in many more projects to digitize analog material, and preserve and make available digital material.  In this session we will update several of those efforts, with a focus on projects aimed at helping to strengthen the global information ecosystem by adding persistent Web URLs to services, by adding links to digital books and academic papers as cited in Wikipedia articles, and to supporting research projects and services working to address the issues of mis- and disinformation.

                <div class="talk-title">The Growth and Decline of Digital Knowledge Commons</div>

                After increasing rapidly over seven years, the number of active
                contributors to English Wikipedia peaked in 2007 and has been in
                decline since. Of course, Wikipedia is only one example of "peer
                production"—a model of collaborative production that also lies
                behind millions of wikis, free/open source software projects,
                websites like OpenStreetMap, and more. Unfortunately, there is
                evidence that English Wikipedia's pattern of growth and decline
                occurs in these other efforts as well. A body of emerging
                scholarship suggests that decline in projects' contributor bases
                tends to coincide with a shift from the lightweight governance and
                porous boundaries closely associated with peer production to less
                open forms of organization.
                <br/>
                Why would successful peer production communities become less open in
                ways that cause a decline in their contributor bases?Drawing from
                research into collective action and public goods as well as Ostrom's
                work on common-pool resources, I will present a theoretical model
                that suggests an answer. I will argue that peer production projects'
                success at building valuable knowledge commons drives both a
                virtuous cycle of good contributions as well as well an influx of
                bad-faith actors in a dynamic set of relationships that leads
                communities to become increasingly closed in order to protect the
                knowledge bases they have built. I will end by presenting a range of
                empirical evidence in support of the model and by discussing some of
                its implications.

                Benjamin Mako Hill is an Assistant Professor in the University of Washington Department of Communication, an Adjunct Assistant Professor in the departments of Human-Centered Design and Engineering and Computer Science and Engineering, and Affiliate Faculty in the Center for Statistics and the Social Sciences, the eScience Institute, and the "Design Use Build" (DUB) group that supports research on on human computer interaction. He is also a Faculty Associate at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University and an affiliate of the Institute of Quantitative Social Science at Harvard. Mako studies collective action in online communities and seeks to understand why some attempts at collaborative production — like Wikipedia and Linux — build large volunteer communities while the vast majority never attract even a second contributor. His research is deeply interdisciplinary, consists primarily of "big data" quantitative analyses, and lies at the intersection of communication, human-computer interaction, and sociology. Mako received his PhD from MIT.

          Wikipedia is one of the most popular sites on the Web, a main source of knowledge for
          a large fraction of Internet users, and one of the very few projects that make not only their
          content but also many activity logs available to the public. Furthermore, other Wikimedia projects,
          such as Wikidata and Wikimedia Commons, have been created to share other types of
          knowledge with the world for free. For a variety of reasons (quality and quantity of content,
          reach in many languages, process of content production, availability of data, etc.) such projects
          have become important objects of study for researchers across many subfields of the computational
          and social sciences, such as social network analysis, artificial intelligence, linguistics,
          natural language processing, social psychology, education, anthropology, political science,
          human&ndash;computer interaction, and cognitive science.
          </p>
          <p>
          The goal of this workshop
          is to bring together researchers exploring all aspects of Wikimedia projects such as Wikipedia,
          Wikidata, and Commons. With members of the Wikimedia Foundation's Research team on the
          organizing committee and with the experience of successful
          workshops in
          <a href="https://wikiworkshop.org/2015/">2015</a>,
          <a href="https://wikiworkshop.org/2016/">2016</a>,
          <a href="https://wikiworkshop.org/2017/">2017</a>,
          <a href="https://wikiworkshop.org/2018/">2018</a>, and
          <a href="https://wikiworkshop.org/2019/">2019</a>,
          we aim to continue facilitating a direct pathway for exchanging ideas between the organization that
          coordinates Wikimedia projects and the researchers interested in studying them.
          </p>
          <p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to</p>
          <ul>
            <li>new technologies and initiatives to grow content, quality, diversity, and participation across Wikimedia projects</li>
            <li>use of bots, algorithms, and crowdsourcing strategies to curate, source, or verify content and structured data</li>
            <li>bias in content and gaps of knowledge</li>
            <li>diversity of Wikimedia editors and users</li>
            <li>detection of low-quality, promotional, or fake content, as well as fake accounts (e.g., sock puppets)</li>
            <li>questions related to community health (e.g., sentiment analysis, harassment detection)</li>
            <li>understanding editor motivations, engagement models, and incentives</li>
            <li>Wikimedia consumer motivations and their needs: readers, researchers, tool/API developers</li>
            <li>innovative uses of Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects for AI and NLP applications</li>
            <li>consensus-finding and conflict resolution on editorial issues</li>
            <li>participation in discussions and their dynamics</li>
            <li>dynamics of content reuse across projects and the impact of policies and community norms on reuse</li>
            <li>privacy</li>
            <li>collaborative content creation (unstructured, semi-structured, or structured)</li>
            <li>innovative uses of Wikimedia projects' content and consumption patterns as sensors for real-world events, culture, etc.</li>
            <li>open-source research code, datasets, and tools to support research on Wikimedia contents and communities</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Papers should be 1 to 8 pages long and will be published on the workshop webpage and optionally (depending on the authors' choice) in the workshop proceedings.
            The review process will be single-blind (as opposed to double-blind), i.e., authors should include their names and affiliations in their submissions.
            Authors whose papers are accepted to the workshop will have the opportunity to participate in a poster session.
