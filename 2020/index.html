                                Jerome is an Assistant Research Professor at the French
                                National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), a Research Affiliate at
                                the Center for Law and Economics at ETH Zurich, and a Faculty Associate
                                at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard
                                University. Jerome is a behavioral economist operating at the
                                boundaries between psychology, economics and computational social
                                science. In his research, he couples experimental methods with the
                                analysis of big data to uncover how psychological and cognitive traits
                                shape our behavior over the Internet, with a particular focus on online
                                cooperation, peer production and decision making. Jerome's most recent
                                research leverages field data from several Internet-based environments,
                                such as online poker, open source software development platforms, and
                                Wikipedia. His current interests relate to the study of how people deal
                                with their decision making biases, as well as the determinants and
                                consequences of communication style and leadership in virtual teamwork.

                                Benjamin Mako Hill is an Assistant Professor in the University of Washington Department of Communication, an Adjunct Assistant Professor in the departments of Human-Centered Design and Engineering and Computer Science and Engineering, and Affiliate Faculty in the Center for Statistics and the Social Sciences, the eScience Institute, and the "Design Use Build" (DUB) group that supports research on on human computer interaction. He is also a Faculty Associate at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University and an affiliate of the Institute of Quantitative Social Science at Harvard. Mako studies collective action in online communities and seeks to understand why some attempts at collaborative production — like Wikipedia and Linux — build large volunteer communities while the vast majority never attract even a second contributor. His research is deeply interdisciplinary, consists primarily of "big data" quantitative analyses, and lies at the intersection of communication, human-computer interaction, and sociology. Mako received his PhD from MIT.

                                Misha Teplitskiy is an Assistant Professor at the School of Information, University of Michigan. His research is at the intersection of Science of Science + Sociology of Organizations + Computational Social Science. He studies how social and organizational factors affect scientific discovery. He is especially interested in evaluation practices in science, and whether they promote or stifle innovation. My approach relies primarily on field experiments -- interventions in scientific competitions and other settings -- and applying computational tools to large-scale observational data. Previously, he was a postdoc at the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (LISH). He received his PhD in Sociology from the University of Chicago, where he was a member of KnowledgeLab.

                            Wikipedia is one of the most popular sites on the Web, a main source of knowledge for
                            a large fraction of Internet users, and one of the very few projects that make not only their
                            content but also many activity logs available to the public. Furthermore, other Wikimedia projects,
                            such as Wikidata and Wikimedia Commons, have been created to share other types of
                            knowledge with the world for free. For a variety of reasons (quality and quantity of content,
                            reach in many languages, process of content production, availability of data, etc.) such projects
                            have become important objects of study for researchers across many subfields of the computational
                            and social sciences, such as social network analysis, artificial intelligence, linguistics,
                            natural language processing, social psychology, education, anthropology, political science,
                            human&ndash;computer interaction, and cognitive science.

                            The goal of this workshop
                            is to bring together researchers exploring all aspects of Wikimedia projects such as Wikipedia,
                            Wikidata, and Commons. With members of the Wikimedia Foundation's Research team on the
                            organizing committee and with the experience of successful
                            workshops in

                            we aim to continue facilitating a direct pathway for exchanging ideas between the organization that
                            coordinates Wikimedia projects and the researchers interested in studying them.

                            Authors whose papers are accepted to the workshop will have the opportunity to participate in a poster session.
